clean_and_combine_data.R combines and cleans Afrobarometer rounds 3, 4, and 7 and outputs afpr_append.rds. For round 7, there are three datasets to combine: Mauritius, Uganda, and the full Round 7 Afrobaromter dataset. These three datasets are combined before merging into rounds 3 and 4.

append_age_differences.R appends age difference variables to the Afrobarometer data based on the ages of interviewers and respondents and saves this as a new dataset: afpr_ages.rds.

variable_labels.R generates a dataframe of variable names, variable descriptions, and variable groupings. This dataframe is used in subsequent files to group and relabel outcomes.

balance_tables.R uses afpr_ages.rds to generate the covariate balance table found in Table 3 of the paper.
descriptive_statistics.R uses afpr_ages.rds to create tables and figures that compare the age distributions of respondents and interviewers in the Afrobarometer data (Table 2 and Figure 1 in the paper). This file also creates tables that compare the responses of older and younger interviewers (Table 4 and Table 5 in the paper).

contrasts.R runs the main models (with 35-years old age cutoff) as well as the appendix models (with 40-years old age cutoff and 10-year age difference) using afpr_ages.rds. Model estimates are tidied into a dataframe and saved as age_diff_models.rds.

plots.R creates plots of our main findings (Figures 2 to 5) and the plots found in the appendix of the paper (Figures 6 to 13).

comparison_plots is the code for the predicted probabilities plots - to be edited. Same dependencies as contrasts.R. 

contrasts_logistic.R runs the logistic and ordered logistic regressions and outputs a list of models. Same dependencies as contrasts.R. No outputs - could be irrelevant. 

cross_validation.R conducts cross-validations between logistic/ordered and linear regressions. Same dependencies as contrasts.R. 

presentable_table.R makes tables for the main paper which only show the direction and significance of the results. Same dependencies as plots.R. 

regression_table.R creates full regression tables to go into the appendix. Same dependencies as contrasts.R. 

results_tables.R creates tables with the estimate and standard error. Same dependencies as plots.R. 

flipped_plot_test.R and marginal_effects.R were not relevant and so were removed.
